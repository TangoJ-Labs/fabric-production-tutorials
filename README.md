# Hyperledger Fabric Production Setup Tutorials

Most Hyperledger Fabric examples provide highly automated network setup scripts that do not handle cryptographic data in a way that resembles a production environment with isolated organizations, differing setup timelines, etc.

### This repository provides tutorials for **intentionally manual** network setup procedures.  These packages are *not* intended for a quick setup, but to provide:
- Education regarding the general layout of a Hyperledger Fabric network
- Demonstrations of best practices procedures for production environment setups
